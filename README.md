# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A responsive **To-Do List Web Application** built during my internship at **SkillCraft Technology** as a **Web Developer Intern**.  
This project helps users manage daily tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.  
It also provides an interactive UI with an empty-state illustration for a better user experience.
